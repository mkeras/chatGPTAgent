# chatGPTAgent
 A container that subscribes to a given topic, processes the incoming messages using a given chatGPT model and prompt and publishes the result to a given topic. The idea is to have these configured to be connected to a UNS with specific tasks.

 This project is under development. Between program logic and whats available with the chatGPT api (function calling, chaining prompts together, etc), there are many features and functions to add to this image.
